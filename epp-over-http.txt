Abstract

   This document describes how an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
   session is mapped onto a sequence of HTTP requests and responses.
   This mapping requires use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   protocol to protect information exchanged between an EPP client and
   an EPP server.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   This document describes how the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP) is mapped onto a sequence of HTTP requests and responses.
   Transport security is provided by the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   Protocol [RFC2246].  EPP is described in [RFC5730].  HTTP/1.1 is
   described in [RFC2616].

   [RFC5734] describes how to map EPP onto stateful TCP connections.
   Since the publication of that document, HTTP has gained wide adoption
   for transporting a wide variety of application data.  HTTP provides
   several advantages over direct TCP for transporting data, including a
   wide variety of off-the-shelf server implementations, standards for
   authentication, proxy support, etc.  Furthermore, HTTP provides a
   simpler mechanism for scaling due to its stateless nature.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Session Management

   As HTTP is a stateless protocol, each HTTP request must contain all
   of the information necessary to establish the identity of the EPP
   client.  The EPP "<login>" and "<logout>" commands are not applicable
   when using HTTP as the transport protocol, rather authentication
   credentials MUST be sent on each request using standard HTTP
   authentication mechanisms.

   The EPP "<login>" command can be mapped to HTTP headers as follows:

3.  Message Exchange

   HTTP servers that support EPP over HTTP must support HTTP requests
   with a single EPP frame.  Servers MAY support multipart messages.

   When the body of the HTTP request contains a single EPP frame, the
   content type of the HTTP message MUST be "application/epp+xml".

   When a multipart body is used, the body content type MUST be
   "multipart/mixed" and MUST define the boundry.  Each part MUST
   contain a single EPP frame and the content type of each part MUST be
   "application/epp+xml".  In multipart messages, each part MUST be
   processed in the order it appears in the multipart body.

   When a server receives an HTTP request with a single frame, the HTTP
   response content type MUST be "application/epp+xml".

   When a server receives a multipart HTTP request, the HTTP response
   content type MUST be "multipart/mixed" and MUST define the boundry.
   The content type for each part of the multipart response MUST be
   "application/epp+xml".

   When a client receives a multipart HTTP response, the client MUST
   process each part in the order it appears in the multipart body.

   EPP errors MUST be returned as part of the EPP response XML, not as
   HTTP error codes.  HTTP error codes are reserved for HTTP errors
   only.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD
